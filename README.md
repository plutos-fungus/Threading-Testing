# Threading-Testing
I'm just making this repo to learn about multithreading in C#

First I thought it would be a good idea to just read random numbers from a file and then do some theading with that.
But there werent enough items in the file I used to show any big difference. So I just used a ```for (int i = 0; i < value; i++)```, so I could 
easely change the value of items to work with
